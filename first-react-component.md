### React Components

React applications are made of components.

What's a component?

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML and re-render it when some data changes.

Take a look at the code below. This code will create and render a new React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(
document.getElementById('app')
).render(<MyComponent />);
```

A lot of these look unfamiliar but do not worry. We are going to unpack that code, one small piece at a time. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll understand how to build a React component!
